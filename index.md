description: A How-to Guide supporting researchers with practical instructions for making their software findable and citable.
---


Software is central to contemporary scientific research, and as a result should be findable, understandable and citable. This How-to Guide seeks to clarify the practical steps a software creator can follow to achieve this outcome. 

This web resource is paired with a manuscript in preparation that describes the **`Why`** and **`How`** of making software
findable and citable. This resource expands on the **`How`** and adds **`Examples`** for each step.


## The steps
