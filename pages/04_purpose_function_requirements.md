## How?

{% include callout.html type="note" content="This is a message box. Use the content included here to emphasise important points." %}

## Why?


## Examples

We have included examples here that follow one or more annotation and documentation best practices:

- PacBio HiFi genome assembly using hifiasm[Price2022].
- rnaseq nf-core workflow[Patel2023]. 
- bio-cwl-tools collection (https://github.com/common-workflow-library/bio-cwl-tools): includes tools and workflows that embed metadata into the CWL code. For example, `Kraken2` [Wood2019] in this collection uses Schema.org [Guha2015] metadata annotations: https://github.com/common-workflow-library/bio-cwl-tools/blob/258190fac5bb35500544229ff9d679026b5f3aeb/kraken2/kraken2.cwl .
