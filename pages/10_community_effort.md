## Why?

{% include callout.html type="note" content="This is a message box. Use the content included here to emphasise important points." %}


## How?


## Examples

Using a Nextflow computational workflow as an example, there are effectively three levels of community involvement.

1. Just adopting Nextflow, as it is a popular and well maintained workflow language.
2. Following community defined (i.e. nf-core) workflow development best practices.
3. Joining the nf-core community and contributing a workflow directly to their existing maintained collection.



### R

{% tool "bioconductor" %}


### Python



### NextFlow 

nf-core is a significant effort in this space, and there are talks, training and hackathons you can join. Check out their [`Join nf-core`](https://nf-co.re/join) page to find out how to get involved. 


### Snakemake

Visit the Snakemake community website https://snakemake.github.io/, and donâ€™t forget to check the different ways you can get support https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#support


### Common workflow language (CWL)

https://www.commonwl.org/community/


### Galaxy

The Galaxy project has many communities that address software. The most prominent include the Intergalactic Utilities Commission (IUC) and IWC who look after software tools and computational workflows respectively. There are also many domain specific communities as well, including for example, microGalaxy and Galaxy-Proteomics (Galaxy-P).


### Research software engineering (RSE) societies 

Are you not sure which community to join? You could start by joining one of the many [RSE societies that exist globally](https://researchsoftware.org/). These communities directly address many of the challenges faced by creators of research-centric software, including visibility of their contribution to research.
