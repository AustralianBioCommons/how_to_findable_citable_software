## Why?


## How?

You need to version control your work in a public repository.

1. The first step is picking a suitable repository. Some options include:

- {% tool "github" %},
- {% tool "gitlab" %}

2. If you aren't sure, you can check out {% tool "alt_to_vcs" %} to find more version control systems.


## Examples

Here, we provide two examples of version controlled workflows. The first is a Galaxy workflow from the {% tool "galaxy-iwc" %} called `COVID-19: variation analysis on ARTIC PE data` [Maier2022], and the second is a Nextflow workflow called `SAMBA: Standardized and Automated MetaBarcoding Analyses workflow` [Cormier2021].
