**You need to version control your software in a publicly accessible repository.**


## How?

1. The first step is picking a suitable repository. Some popular options include {% tool "github" %} and {% tool "gitlab" %}.
2. If you aren't sure, or you are looking for more options, you can check out {% tool "alt_to_vcs" %} to find more version control systems.


## Examples

Here, we provide two examples of version controlled workflows:

- Galaxy workflow from the {% tool "galaxy-iwc" %}: `COVID-19: variation analysis on ARTIC PE data` {% cite maier_sars-cov-2-pe-illumina-artic-variant-callingcovid-19-pe-artic-illumina_2022 %}, and 
- Nextflow workflow: `SAMBA: Standardized and Automated MetaBarcoding Analyses workflow` {% cite cormier_samba_2021 %}.
