{% include callout.html type="important" content="A DOI is a persistent identifier, and allows unambiguous linking to your software." %}


## How?


## Example

We have included examples of publications where WorkflowHub DOIs are included: providing persistent links to workflows:

- {% cite satgunaseelan_viral_2022 %}
- {% cite atasoy_microbial_2023 %}
- {% cite lott_futureproofing_2022 %}

You can find additional examples by searching Google Scholar for the core 
element of the WorkflowHub DOI: `10.48546/WORKFLOWHUB.WORKFLOW`.
