## How?

Here, we’ve included some steps to success:

1. Review the [Software Citation Checklist for Developers](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3482769) [ChueHong2019].
2. Identify all the software that made a significant contribution to your research, check the software developer’s [recommended citation methods](08_citation_instructions), and cite both the code and any journal publications.
3. Create citations that won’t break using persistent identifiers like [DOIs](07_doi). 
4. Software hosting services like {% tool "github" %}, SourceForge, and {% tool "workflowhub" %} currently provide some support for software citations using DOIs issued by platforms like Zenodo and DataCite. For example, GitHub’s integration with Zenodo allows users to access a version controlled citation directly from the software repository.
5. Many journals actually restrict the number of citations that you can have, and unfortunately it's often the case that software citations are the ones that get left out. A tip here is to then include these additional citations in the supplementary materials.


## Examples

- {% tool "cran" %} provides the following documentation on how to [Report and Cite Packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/report/vignettes/cite_packages.html).
