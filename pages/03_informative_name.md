Table 1. Features of a good software name.

| Feature                | What do we really mean?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Short & Human readable | 6 - 15 characters. Shorter names are easy to search, remember, write and can increase name recognition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Unique & searchable    | Make sure the name is easy for a search engine to find. Don’t pick a common or popular name that means something else: if the name doesn't clash with other findable things, it can be found immediately when searching, or it will be at the top of the search engine result.                                                                                                                      |
| Informative            | If possible, the name can explain what the tool or workflow does. Good examples are `BEDtools` and `SAMtools`, as the names mention the data formats used (BED, SAM) and suggest that the software encompasses many tools. Some names don’t really tell you anything about the software. As an example, accept this challenge: Pokémon or big data term http://pixelastic.github.io/pokemonorbigdata/ ? |
| Avoid prefixes e.g. `bio` | Don't use a prefix like `bio` in the name if it could be reused outside of the biosciences domain. The same applies for `geo`, `astro`, `eco` etc. You will notice that some popular tools and platforms are exceptions to this rule (e.g. `bio.tools`).                                                                                                                                                    |
| Use ASCII | Computers and search engines don’t like complex characters and white spaces: use the ASCII standard. The key reason to avoid complex characters is that they create issues for findability if a software registry doesn't process these characters properly or if the name is challenging for a user to type.                                                                                       |


## Examples

Great software name examples include `WorkflowHub` (https://workflowhub.eu/), `FASTQC` (https://bio.tools/fastqc) and `hifiadapterfilt` (https://bio.tools/hifiadapterfilt). Each name is short, unique, searchable, and provides information about the software while avoiding both the `bio` prefix and complex characters.
