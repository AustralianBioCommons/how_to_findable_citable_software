type: steps

## Why?


## How?

{% tool "orcid" %}


## Examples

Here are some examples to show how ORCID connects the dots. If you create workflows or tools, you can tie your collective works together with an ORCID. An ORCID plus DOIs equals a record of connected outputs:

- The {% tool "galaxy" %} workflow design GUI (also called the "canvas") has a `Creator` field in its best practice metadata wizard, and an adjacent `Identifier` field that encourages the use of an ORCID.
- {% tool "workflowhub" %} encourages each registered user to uniquely identify themselves using an ORCID iD: this is part of the recommended metadata.
- You can link your GitHub account directly to your ORCID, by adding your ORCID link to the social accounts section of your [GitHub profile settings](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#adding-links-to-your-social-accounts). This will enable you to credit your contributions to all GitHub-hosted projects through your ORCID profile.
