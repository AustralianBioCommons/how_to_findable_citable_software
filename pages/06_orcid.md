{% include callout.html type="important" content="An ORCID plus DOIs equals a record of connected outputs!" %}


## How?

1. Visit the {% tool "orcid" %} website.
2. Click on `SIGN IN / REGISTER`.
3. Follow the instructions in the registration wizard to create your ORCID iD.
4. See the [ORCID support page](https://support.orcid.org) to discover how you can use your ORCID.

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="You can add your ORCID iD whenever a platform or service provides this as an option - for example Zenodo, WorkflowHub, conference platforms, and journals / publishers." %}


## Examples

Here are some examples to show how ORCID connects the dots. If you create workflows or tools, you can tie your collective works together with an ORCID.

- The {% tool "galaxy" %} workflow design GUI (also called the "canvas") has a `Creator` field in its best practice metadata wizard, and an adjacent `Identifier` field that encourages the use of an ORCID.
- {% tool "workflowhub" %} encourages each registered user to uniquely identify themselves using an ORCID iD: this is part of the recommended metadata.
- You can link your GitHub account directly to your ORCID, by adding your ORCID link to the social accounts section of your [GitHub profile settings](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#adding-links-to-your-social-accounts). This will enable you to credit your contributions to all GitHub-hosted projects through your ORCID profile.
