## How?

Select a registry based on the type of software you want to register. If you aren't sure, you can use resources like {% tool "re3data" %} {% cite gfz_german_research_centre_for_geosciences_registry_2013 %}, {% tool "fairsharing" %} {% cite sansone_fairsharing_2019 %} or {% tool "awesome-research-software-registries-list" %} to search for a suitable registry.

For example, you can [search FAIRsharing for workflows](https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database&q=workflows).

You can also find a selection of suitable registries listed in the [examples section below](#examples).
