**To ensure others can reuse your software, you need to license it for reuse.**


## How?

Use one of the following resources to select a suitable licence for your work.

- {% tool "choosealicense" %},
- {% tool "tldr-legal" %}


## Example

A short and simple permissive licence is `MIT` {% cite noauthor_mit_nodate noauthor_open_2021 %}. The only conditions of use are that you preserve the copyright 
and licence notices. Choosing an MIT licence means you are permitting: commercial use, distribution, modification, sublicense (extend 
or remove rights of the original licence), and private use. The limitations exist to protect the author, and do not provide warranty 
of any kind. The work is provided "as is" and users may not hold the author liable. 

Key groups in the bioinformatics community (e.g. {% tool "nf-core" %} and {% tool "snakemake-community" %}) recommend this licence.
