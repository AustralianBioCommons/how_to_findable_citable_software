## Example

A short and simple permissive licence is MIT [SPDX2023][FOSSA2021]. The only conditions of use are that you preserve the copyright 
and licence notices. Choosing an MIT licence means you are permitting: commercial use, distribution, modification, sublicense (extend 
or remove rights of the original licence), and private use. The limitations exist to protect the author, and do not provide warranty 
of any kind. The work is provided "as is" and users may not hold the author liable. 

Key groups in the bioinformatics community (e.g. nf-core and snakemake-workflows) recommend this licence.
